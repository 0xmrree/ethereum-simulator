An RPC server (standing for Remote Procedure Call) is basically a special type of Ethereum full node that exposes an API interface over the internet that clients not part of the Ethereum network can send requests to. It's called a remote procedure call because clients send requests that essentially execute functions on the remote full node. Some basic operations the RPC server exposes to the world include, but are not limited to: sending transactions to both EOAs and smart contracts, retrieving information via internal data structures in the node such as the blockchain itself, and accessing metadata generated from the chain such as receipts. From my understanding, nodes run the RPC interface out of the goodness of their heart—they don't get paid for it.
