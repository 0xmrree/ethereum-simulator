also im realizing subnets are more of a protocol thing. basically, if you have a topic with one publisher per slot, gossip sub scales really nicely where the whole network can easily get the message in several hops. but in the case of attestations - you have a ton of people publishing at once. The solution is simple - have 64 different topics, then a RANDAO-style chosen aggregator listens to their assigned subnet topic, collects attestations, and publishes an aggregate to a global topic that will only have about 64 publishers per slot which is fine. this logic applies to both sync committees and attestations. gossipsub solves the scaling issue of one to many in P2P networks but does poorly when trying to scale many to many - eth uses subnet topics and aggregators to solve this
