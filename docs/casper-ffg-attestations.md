# Casper FFG Attestations and Checkpoint Mechanics
Attestations are to the CL what transactions are to the EL. Now Attestations modify the state in the beacon state. In the beacon state there contains a prevous and current justified checkpoint and a finialized checkpoint. The values are modified by applying attetstaions from a processed block to our beacon state. 
Note in an attestion the attested block for the attestation is not directly used to modify out state in our state machine, rather what is strickly used to modify out beacon state is out casper ffg source and ffg target votes. When ever validator clients create attestions they must calcuate a source checkout and a target checkpount which is strickly a function of their conaical tree in the beacon node. Specifallt their source checkout is simple the current jsutified checkpopoint in valdidator clients beacon node. Simple! Now the target checkpoint is the block at teh first slot in the current epoch, or if that slot is empty, the most recent block before it. Another way to say it is that the source is a fucntion of a beacon node's conicanl chain. 
Now when attestations are process and applied to ones beacon state they upadte a local store of casper ffg votes where validators vote epochs checkpoints. A vote is only counter for a epoch + validator if and only if the source checkoint of the attestation is equal to the current jsutified checkpoint.
