# Casper FFG Attestations and Checkpoint Mechanics
Attestations are to the CL what transactions are to the EL. Attestations modify the state in the beacon state. In the beacon state, there are previous and current justified checkpoints and a finalized checkpoint. These values are modified by applying attestations from a processed block to our beacon state.
Note that in an attestation, the attested block for the attestation is not directly used to modify our state in our state machine; rather, what is strictly used to modify our beacon state are our Casper FFG source and FFG target votes. Whenever validator clients create attestations, they must calculate a source checkpoint and a target checkpoint, which is strictly a function of their canonical tree in the beacon node. Specifically, their source checkpoint is simply the current justified checkpoint in the validator client's beacon node. Simple! Now the target checkpoint is the block at the first slot in the current epoch, or if that slot is empty, the most recent block before it. Another way to say it is that the target is a function of a beacon node's canonical chain.
Now when attestations are processed and applied to one's beacon state, they update a local store of Casper FFG votes where validators vote on epoch checkpoints. A vote is only counted for an epoch and validator if and only if the source checkpoint of the attestation is equal to the current justified checkpoint.
